<p>
  We observed a clear inverse correlation between tweet volume and tweet sentiment. That is, on days when there were more tweets, tweet sentiment tended to be lower. This association was very strong, with a highly significant p-value in all instances.</p>
<p>
We did not clearly identify a causal pathway for this association, but rather developed tow theories which provide the basis for future research. The first theory is that on days when people have bad experiences related to Megabus, they will tend to tweet more, because often people tweet to complain. The second theory is that on days when there are more Megabuses on the road, there are naturally more tweets due to the larger group of passengers, and that when there is more Megabus activity there will tend to be a higher risk of breakdowns, delays, traffic jams, and other negative experiences.
</p>
<p>
It is entirely plausible that both of these effects are causing the association, or perhaps just one, or perhaps the association is by chance.
</p>
<p>
To test these theories, we would need to obtain data on Megabus activity, perhaps by scraping a travel site. Then we could determine if tweet activity is primarily an indicator Megabus activity, or a downstream consequence of negative Megabus experiences, or both.
</p>
<p>
Through our work, we hope to help people understand the trends in Megabus tweet sentiment so that they can make informed decisions and have the best Megabus experience possible!
